## What are Spot Features?

Each parking spot has some features to it that affect who can park there, and
who WANTS to park there. Features like accessible parking, an electric charger,
or an extra wide spot.

## How can I configure features for my parking spots?

Well... You can't yet. It's on the roadmap. When we'll do it, we'll update this
documentation.

If you have any specific requests or want to push this feature, feel free to
[contact us](/contact)!
