## Where's the Roadmap?

We're currently managing the roadmap on our personal Notion account, so it's not
public. We're planning to move it to GitHub projects to make it public :)

## What are the main items on the roadmap?

- Change responses to Block Kit, to make the UX better.
- Automatic self-serve signup and setup experience.
- Create a "Home" for the app, with the status of current garages.
- Create weekly reports.
- Add payment options.

## When can we expect them?

Right now, this project is a side hobby for us. So no guarantees!
