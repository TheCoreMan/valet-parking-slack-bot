Let's keep it simple:

* We only look at commands sent to the bot - who sent them, what did they ask,
etc.
* We store info about the commands, so that the bot can reserve spots and create
reports.
* That info is stored on Google Cloud storage and that's it.
* We're not sharing the data with other parties, but we might look at it from
time to time.
